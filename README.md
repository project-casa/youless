Due to memory limitations the YouLess energy monitor device stores data of shorter intervals for only a short period of time. For example, for minute intervals this is maximum 10 hours (depending on device version). After that the data is gone. This service aims to solve this problem by storing the monitored data of each interval for a much longer period of time. And do this for multiple YouLess devices. In the future an API compatible with YouLess' own API will provide the same data so any existing clients should work pretty much out of the box.

Key features are:
- no more limits on monitored data
- update data from multiple devices
- support older YouLess versions
- only monitor the data types you want
- configure update intervals
- api to instant trigger an update


## Installation
```docker pull roeldev/casa-youless-logger```


### Docker-compose
```
services:
  youless-logger-service:
    image: roeldev/casa-youless-logger:latest
    volumes:
      - config:/youless-logger/config/
      - data:/youless-logger/data/
      - log:/youless-logger/log/
```


### Volumes
| Path | Contains |
|------|----------|
|```/youless-logger/config```| Config files
|```/youless-logger/data```| Database (backup) files
|```/youless-logger/log```| Log files


## Configuration
Support for multiple YouLess devices means a little more configuration. Altough it should be pretty self explanatory, most important stuff is mentioned in this chapter. But first, have a look at the [sample config](youless-logger/config/config-sample.php) for a quick overview of possibilities.

Each device should have at least a host option set so the logger can reach the device's API. All other values are optionable. However this probably results in way too much useless data and disables classic API support. Therefore it's recommended to only enable the data type(s) that are actually used.
> **Note:** Latest YouLess devices support data from three different counters: power, gas and s0. Older versions only support power.

Below example adds two devices:
1. 'house' which requires a password to access the API on '192.168.1.27' and provides data of power and gas usage;
2. 'shed' which is hosted on '192.168.1.32' and only provides data of the s0 pulse counter.

```
'devices' => [
    'house' => [
        'host' => 'http://192.168.1.27',
        'password' => 'secret',
        'update' => [
            'power' => true,
            'gas' => true,
            's0' => false,
        ]
    ],
    'shed' => [
        'host' => 'http://192.168.1.32'
        'update' => [ 's0' ]
    ]
]
```


## CLI
A CLI tool is available to display info or communicate with the configured devices. Login to the Docker container and use `yl list` to list all available commands. It is also possible to run the tool outside of the Docker container via `docker exec -it {container_name} yl {command}`.


## Stored data
A new SQLite database is created on first run. All data values are stored in the `data` table whitin this database.


### Intervals
| Id | Interval | API equiv. | Unit (power/s0) | Unit (gas) |
|----|-----------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | minute | h | watt | n/a
| 2 | 10 mins | w | watt | liter
| 3 | hour | d | watt | liter
| 4 | day | m | kWh | m3 (cubic meter)

### Units
| Id | Unit | API equiv. | Type |
|----|------|------------|------|
| 1 | watt | Watt | power/s0
| 2 | kwh | kWh | power/s0
| 3 | liter | l | gas
| 4 | m3 | m3 | gas
